"To begin with, we didn’t initially know which consumers might convert to Private Wealth Management (PWM) clients. However, we do have a clear picture of our existing PWM clients. Our thinking is simple: consumers who share similar behaviors or characteristics with our current PWM clients are likely good candidates for PWM services.

So, our first step is to look at the existing PWM clients. Given the wealth segment data, we categorize them into High Net Worth and Affluent clients. This segmentation sets a foundation for our prospecting model."

Slide 2
“Once we have the segments, we build separate prospecting models for High Net Worth and Affluent clients. Using historical data on each segment, we develop features based on our available data to represent each client.

These features are then used to create our prospecting models, one for High Net Worth clients and another for Affluent clients. This approach allows each model to learn from past client behaviors and the model will understand how existing PWM clients look like.

Step 3
“With our prospecting models in place, the next step is to apply them to all our consumers. We created features for each consumer using the exact the same methodology for creating the exsisting PWM features, the same features used in the models, and feed them into the High Net Worth and Affluent prospecting models. Since the model already know how the exsisting PWM clients look like, the model will justify for each consumer, whether each consumer looks like exsisting PWM. If looks like, then it becomes a prospect.”

Slide 4: Business Flow Summary
“To summarize the business flow: We start by dividing existing PWM clients into High Net Worth and Affluent segments. Using the data gathered from these groups, we build prospecting models linked to each segment. Then, all consumers are evaluated based on these models to generate prospect lists.

Slide 5: Data Source and Feature Selection/Engineering
“To create an accurate model, data is key. Our model utilizes various of data sources. From these sources, we engineer about 56 features that cover key aspects like demographics, behavior, balances, product distribution, revenue, and transaction.

Slide 6: Key Feature Review - Balance
“Balance is one of the core indicators of a client’s wealth potential. Here, we compare the balance distribution of prospects with that of High Net Worth and Affluent clients.

As you can see, the balance distribution of our prospects aligns closely with that of the High Net Worth and Affluent groups, indicating that our prospecting model can identify consumers who has similar balance behaviors to these exsisting PWMs.”

Slide 7: Key Feature Review - Product Distribution
“Next, we look at another example, product distribution. High Net Worth and Affluent clients typically hold a wider range of products, including specialized wealth products.

Our prospecting model has identified consumers with similar diversified product usage patterns, which suggests a strong potential for wealth management. While consumers lean toward products like checking and credit cards, prospects tend to display a slight diversification, aligning them with High Net Worth or Affluent client behaviors.”

Slide 8: Model Evaluation - Conversion Definition
Comiong to how we evaluate our model. A valid conversion occurs when a consumer, initially without any PWM relationship, becomes a PWM client within the following six months.

Our goal is to capture a high conversion rate, which reflects the model’s accuracy in identifying genuine prospects. As of our latest run, our conversion capture rates are 78% for High Net Worth prospects and 72% for Affluent prospects. This high capture rate indicates that our model is performing well in identifying high-potential clients.”

Slide 9: Model Evaluation - Example
“Let me illustrate with an example. Here we have Hank Meeks, a consumer without any PWM relationship as of September 30, 2023. Our model identified him as a high-potential prospect. On April 30, 2024, Hank becomes a PWM client, which validates our model’s prediction.

This example shows how the model matches individual prospects with cluster insights, such as average balance and transaction patterns, to ensure targeted recommendations. Our goal is to make predictions that align closely with these high-potential clients and enhance advisor decision-making.”
