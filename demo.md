Slide 1: Introducing Wealth Management Business Flow
"To begin with, we didn’t initially know which consumers might convert to Private Wealth Management (PWM) clients. However, we do have a clear picture of our existing PWM clients. Our thinking is simple: consumers who share similar behaviors or characteristics with our current PWM clients are likely good candidates for PWM services.

So, our first step is to look at the existing PWM clients. Given the wealth segment data, we categorize them into High Net Worth and Affluent clients. This segmentation, based on existing data, allows us to define what each of these groups looks like in terms of their financial behaviors and characteristics, setting a foundation for our prospecting model."

Slide 2
“Once we have the segments, we build separate prospecting models for High Net Worth and Affluent clients. Using historical data on each segment, we develop features based on our available data to represent each clients.

These features are then used to create our prospecting models, one for High Net Worth clients and another for Affluent clients. This approach allows each model to learn from past client behaviors and the model will understand how existing PWM clients look like.

Step 3
“With our prospecting models in place, the next step is to apply them to all our consumers. We first extract the relevant features for each consumer, the same features used in the models, and feed them into the High Net Worth and Affluent prospecting models. The result is a targeted list of high-potential consumers, divided into two groups: High Net Worth prospects and Affluent prospects.”
