I'm really passionate about focusing on the tech side of data science and continuing to grow my expertise in this area. In the short term, I want to enhance my skills in advanced machine learning techniques, particularly in deep learning and large scale machine learning systems. Ultimately, I’d love to become an expert in these fields and contribute to cutting-edge project and innovation. I want to specialize in areas like recommenders, or large-scale machine learning systems, and my goal is to contribute to technical innovation in these areas, developing new applications. 

Currently, we predict on historical data, assuming a recommendation was made and then observing if the customer opens the product within six months. However, this doesn’t reflect real feedback because customers might open the product naturally, not because of our recommendation. Additionally, some products might not be opened simply because customers aren’t aware of them. If they were recommended, they might open them. Hence, our current model assumptions aren’t as accurate as direct customer feedback would be. We need to design a mechanism to collect direct customer feedback, specifically whether they accept or reject the product after seeing the recommendation. This real feedback data will greatly enhance the precision and effectiveness of our recommendation system.

Another significant issue is that our data lacks information on customers' web browsing behavior. Currently, our data is mainly from transaction balances and account activities, but we don’t have any data on how customers interact with our website or app, such as which pages they visit, where they click, and how long they stay on each page. For a recommendation system, this behavioral data is very important as it helps us understand customer interests and actions better, leading to more accurate recommendations. Since we have our website and app, it’s technically feasible to collect this data from the app side.

However, implementing these changes requires collaboration beyond our data science team. I’m unsure who to collaborate with or how to initiate this process, and whether other departments would be willing to participate. Can you provide guidance on which departments we should involve, and how best to approach them to ensure we can gather the necessary customer feedback and web browsing data?
